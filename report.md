# Report on Neural Network Model for Alphabet Soup

## Overview of the Analysis
Alphabet Soup is a nonprofit foundation that aims to make a meaningful impact by providing funding to organizations. However, ensuring that funds are utilized effectively is a challenge, and the foundation wants to improve its funding decision-making process. The purpose of this analysis is to create a predictive model that will help Alphabet Soup identify the applicants most likely to succeed in utilizing the funds they receive. By leveraging historical data on past applicants and funding outcomes, the model can serve as a tool to inform funding decisions, ultimately increasing the success rate of funded projects.

In this project, we employ a deep learning approach to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a given applicant will be successful with the funding based on their characteristics. The model was trained and optimized on a dataset containing various features, including organizational type, funding request amount, and sector classification. Through this analysis, we aim to enhance the effectiveness of Alphabet Soup’s funding allocations, reduce wasted resources, and contribute to the foundation's overall mission of making a positive impact in society.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- **Target Variable(s):**
  - The target variable for this model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, which indicates whether an organization successfully utilized the funding.

- **Feature Variable(s):**
  - The feature variables for this model include:
    - `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, and `ASK_AMT`.

- **Removed Variables:**
  - The columns `EIN` and `NAME` were removed because they are identifiers and do not provide meaningful information for prediction.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- **Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:**
  - The model initially used a simple architecture with hidden layers using the ReLU activation function and an output layer with the sigmoid activation function, which is appropriate for binary classification.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The initial model achieved a **loss of 0.5668** and an **accuracy of 72.5%**. After several optimization steps, the final model had a **loss of 0.5576** and an **accuracy of 72.2%**. While there was a slight improvement in loss, accuracy remained below the 75% target.

- **Optimization Steps:**
  - To improve the model performance, the following changes were implemented:
    - Dropped the `STATUS` column after identifying it as non-beneficial to the model's predictive ability.
    - Switched from `relu` to `leaky_relu` as the activation function in hidden layers to prevent dead neurons and improve gradient flow.
    - Increased the model complexity by adding additional layers, resulting in a total of four hidden layers, to better capture complex patterns in the data.
    - Added `EarlyStopping` to stop training when validation performance plateaued, preventing overfitting.
    - Increased epochs to 300 and batch size to 64 to give the model more training time and potentially improve convergence.
    - Tried using `tanh` as the activation function in hidden layers, but this did not significantly impact accuracy.

### Summary
The final deep learning model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.2%, which, while close to the target of 75%, did not fully meet it. Despite this, the model can still offer valuable insights for Alphabet Soup. By identifying patterns in the applicant data that correlate with successful use of funds, this model can help Alphabet Soup prioritize applicants with a higher likelihood of success. Although further improvements to the model could be pursued, the current version still serves as a useful tool for guiding funding decisions.

**Recommendation for Alternative Model:**  
To further improve accuracy, we recommend exploring other machine learning models that may better suit this structured dataset. Tree-based algorithms like **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting** are often well-suited to classification tasks involving tabular data. These models can naturally handle categorical features and non-linear relationships, potentially offering a performance boost. Additionally, tree-based models can capture interactions between variables without requiring complex neural network architectures, and ensemble methods can improve robustness by aggregating the predictions of multiple trees. By implementing a Random Forest or Gradient Boosting model, Alphabet Soup may achieve higher accuracy and greater interpretability, allowing for more reliable predictions on funding success.

With continued improvements to the model, Alphabet Soup could increase its confidence in funding decisions, ultimately enhancing the organization’s impact by ensuring that resources are allocated to projects with the highest likelihood of success.
